# React + Vite

I have developed a responsive Weather Application using React.js, that provides real-time weather data for cities worldwide. The application fetches current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, by integrating the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for any city to get up-to-date weather information.

Topics for the GitHub Repository:

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
